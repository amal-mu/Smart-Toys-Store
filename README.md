# Smart-Toys-Store
Database Course
The process of shopping on the web is becoming commonplace. At this time, online shopping is fast gaining ground as an accepted and used business paradigm. In this project, the user is provided with a web site that can be used to buy smart toys online that encouraging kids to learn. To implement this as a website I used XAMPP software and after Apache started in control panel, I was able to make requests to the server in my web browser and run my code which is under XAMPP root on htdocs folder.
